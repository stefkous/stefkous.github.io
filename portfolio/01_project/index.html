</body>

<div class="text_align_post">

Urban Morphology is about the built form of cities, the urban elements and the socio-cultural essences embedded in them. As a broader discipline, it is aimed at understanding psychological and physical demands, socio-cultural preferences, economic objectives or technology requirements and advancement of future cities. 

<br /><br />

Urban vibrancy, on the other hand, is a study observing the connection and communication between urban entities, including people, which is externally manifested by dynamic changes in the spatial dimension. Dense street networks, small and medium-sized blocks, diverse and intense buildings and land uses are some of the main indicators of a vibrant urban space.

<br /><br />

<b>Phoenix</b> aims to promote urban vibrancy, by making use of morphological metrics of the urban environment. <b>Phoenix PobleNou</b> mainly refers to updated plan decisions for 22@ District in Barcelona by providing all the layers of analysis, development and proposal for the radical change that awaits the area in the near future.

<br /><br />

Phoenix PobleNou proposes an inclusive platform to create a communication channel between those who propose changes and those who will experience them in an urban environment.

  <p style="color:Indigo;"><b>THE CONCEPT</b></p>
</body>

<img class="img_row_2" src="/img/phoenix/quotes.gif" alt="" title="Literature Review" />
<br /><br />

Urban vibrancy is an extensive field of study that comes up with different perspectives in different contexts. Jane Jacobs first describe urban vibrancy as the “rich diversity of urban life” referring the interactions between residents and their production or living place [1]. 

<br /><br />

Lynch defined it as the capability of an urban area to “support the vital functions, biological requirements and capabilities of human beings and protect the continuation of the species” [2]. 

<br /><br />

Maas has taken the definition one step further and presented three basic components for urban vitality which are people, their activities and opportunities, and the environment where activities occur” [3]. 

<br /><br />

Also, Montgomery contributed to the conceptualization of the term as an integrated representation of the “many and varied comings and goings, meetings and transactions” [4]

<br /><br />

Considering the above-mentioned conceptualizations, urban vibrancy for us, is a study associated with activity intensity, the diversity of land-use configurations and the accessibility of a place. In other words, dense street networks, small and medium-sized blocks, and the diversification and intensification of building and land use can be considered as the identifiers of a vibrant area [5].

<br /><br /><br /><br />

<body> 
  <p style="color:Indigo;"><b>THE CHALLENGE</b></p>
</body>

<img class="img_row_2" src="/img/phoenix/challenges.jpg" alt="" title="Urban Morphology challenges" />
<br /><br />

The new updated plan for Barcelona’s 22@ innovation district reflects new challenges that respond to today. We aim to respond to this radical changes that awaits the area in the near future, with the tools that we suggest in our project Phoenix. Three of the main conclusions from the updated plan, which were highlighted in our study are[6]:

<br /><br />
1. <b>Green streets</b>: According to the climate adaptation measures, the plan proposes a third of vertical and horizontal streets becoming a network of green axes.

<br /><br />

2. <b>Social Housing</b>: Under the new plan, 30% of the new developed area of 22@ will be dedicated to housing compared to 10% in 2000.

<br /><br />

3. <b>New Sectors</b>: In the original plan, the new companies setting up in the area were mostly tech focused. This has been expanded to businesses in the green, circular economy, social and smart manufacturing sectors that will promote mixed-use spaces.

<br /><br /><br /><br />

  <p style="color:Indigo;"><b>THE METHODOLOGY</b></p>
</body>

<img class="img_row_2" src="/img/phoenix/methodology.jpg" alt="" title="Phoenix PobleNou Methodology" />
<br /><br />

Our 3 basic step building our methodology were: <b>Analysis of the data, Development, and Proposal</b>. 
<br /><br />
<br />For the analysis, our first step was to divide Urban Morphology elements in 4 main categories: Buildings, Blocks, Roads and Point of Interest(POI). Under each category, we used separate layers of analysis to get the total number Urban Vibrancy for each element.<br />
Our second step for the analysis was to analyze the Urban Vibrancy of the Ground Level of our area with the help of site observations. We created our own metrics using the following categories: Mixture of Activities, Existence of Items, Frontage Activeness and Mixture of Uses. Lastly, we analyzed people's behaviour through Twitter and GPS data understanding the movement and accumulation within the space.

<br /><br />

<img class="img_row_2" src="/img/phoenix/sections.gif" alt="" title="Urban Vibrancy Levels in PobleNou" />
<div class="col caption"> The road network of our area was divided in x and y axis and was assigned a value from 0 to 100, based on our metrics for the Vibrancy of Ground Level. In this way, Urban Vibrancy can be studied in relation to morphological parameters, such as building height or road length.</div>

<br /><br /><br /><br />

For the development, we combined the density and entropy maps under 2 categories and then developed  total vibrancy map showing the high, medium, and low vibrancy levels in the study area which help us, in the next step, to propose relevant interventions.

<div class="col caption"> The total Urban Vibrancy levels map consists of the combination of two maps: Vibrancy of Built Environment and and Vibrancy of Ground Level. These maps have been produced by the total sum of Vibrancy Levels of the categories mentioned above. </div>

<br /><br /><br /><br />


<body> 
  <p style="color:Indigo;"><b>USER INTERFACE</b></p>
</body>

As our proposal, Phoenix, promises an inclusive platform both for technical team members who are supposed to explore all layers of analysis and propose possible interventions promoting urban vibrancy. On the other hand, community members are able to follow ongoing projects, vote for, or highlight the proposals suggested by technical teams. Community members also have a chance to join community debates to learn more about the details related to the proposals.

<br /><br />

Logging in as technical team member one can explore the total vibrancy levels in our study area with all layers of analysis mentioned before. It also allows us to select a specific are to see the contribution of either vibrancy of built environment or vibrancy of ground level to the overall vibrancy within the selected area. There is also an option to check the projects which are already started in a specific area.  By turning on each layer of analysis, technical team members have an option to further explore multiple maps separately. Once the layers are analysed and those having rough edges selected, then we can continue with the catalogue of interventions that are affecting the layers that have been selected before.

<br /><br />

We imagine this catalogue consisting of proposals made and uploaded by various technical teams. In the catalogue every proposal is categorized based on the metrics that it affects regarding urban vibrancy. So, after analysing Urban Vibrancy in one area, we can then identify the metrics that are lagging behind, and through the filters we can cluster the proposals that are affecting these specific metrics. After identifying the proposals that are suiting our project, we can select them and visualize the material that each team has uploaded in the toolkit.

<br /><br />

In the visualization panel  we can see the proposals as well as the metrics they are affecting along with our filters. Since ,on one hand we are talking about morphological metrics, the proposals are for sure based on the morphology of the neighbourhoods and the infrastructure.  However, since we are also talking about ground level metrics such as presence of people or how permeable and active the facades are, we understand that the proposals are of course affecting the way people experience space. Besides that, we have 4 more options:  First, the myPhoenix tab where you can save the proposals that you like or want to explore more.  Second, you can locate the proposal so that it can appear in the community member section for them to vote it, and of course you can access the voting results of each proposal. Finally, you can download the documentation for more exploration.

<br /><br />

We believe that the re-evaluation of our decisions is very important. So, after selecting your proposals and adding them to myPhoenix feature you can recalculate the total Urban Vibrancy levels that will occur if you implement the chosen proposals. Finally, you will be able to compare the two results in order to understand how the proposals are affecting the selected area.

<br /><br />

The interface also allows community members to interact actively and participate in the process. Once they login, they will see the overall vibrancy map with ongoing projects where they can check for project details and timelines in their neighbourhoods. In the catalogue, they will see all possible proposals suggested by the technical teams, as explained before. There is also a possibility to highlight any proposal, meaning that a community member wants this to be implemented in his neighbourhood. Or they can leave a comment on the suggested proposals.

<br /><br />

To explore user interface more, please visit our trial run for Phoenix Platform: <a href="http://139.59.138.3/" target="blank"><b> Phoenix PobleNou </b></a> 

<br /><br />

In the next step, community members will be able to see the projects that are having a specific location. Since not all the proposals achieve the level of localization. Here they can see list of interventions with their locations and visualisations. Furthermore, all these proposals will be open to debate  and vote by the community members for active participation.

<br /><br />

<body> 
  <p style="color:Indigo;"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
</body>

As we know, the city is not only what we can see but also what we can not.  Phoenix starts from the morphology of PobleNou to calculate the Vibrancy of Space based on some metrics, but our goal is to create a more dynamic, data-driven and participatory toolkit that will link the future change makers to the community.
