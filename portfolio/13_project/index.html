    <p>The New Old is a collaborative research between The Why Factory and the IAAC Master in City and Technology that explores how we can manage all we leave behind by analyzing what does Old mean and what will become Old in the next years. By understanding its location, size and timeline we envisioned its future -by actions of removing, reusing, relocating and remembering- so we could start answering the question: What will be the New Old and how will it look like?</p>

</body>

In order to define what will be the New Old of the near future, we must understand <b>what makes things become Old</b>. We have to look into our past to understand what are the layers we are on top of. What happens with the past and what do we do with it?

<br /><br />

In the contemporary context – as humanity develops- we need to meet our demands. There is friction created between our endless growth and the limited sources of our planet. We are in <b>a crisis of choice and the awareness of a place</b> -for a replacement that goes beyond orthodoxy- is the ultimate tool for changes. Is It about how much space and cost of opportunity could be created in this process of understanding the past. As we keep evolving, do we keep leaving traces? and how do we handle it? 

<br /><br />

In the context of the lifespan in a timeline, <b>things constantly become old</b>.
